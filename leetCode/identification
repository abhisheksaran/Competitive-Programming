Two Pointers 
(https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-sum-equals-k/discuss/301242/General-summary-of-what-kind-of-problem-can-cannot-solved-by-Two-Pointers)
Now let's generalize the characteristics of the problems that can be solved by two pinters. The summary is simple:
If a wider scope of the sliding window is valid, the narrower scope of that wider scope is valid mush hold.
If a narrower scope of the sliding window is invalid, the wider scope of that narrower scope is invalid mush hold.

Stack
Array is given
brute force is o(n*n)
and if the second loop is dependent on the index of first loop
example: nearest greater to right, nearest greater to left, nearest lesser to right and nearest lesser to left etc.

Heap
Array is given, k is given 
and largest or smallest keyword is there

Sliding Window
There would be sequential dependency.(substring, sunarray)
and then there is max, min, contains kind of question on all such possible seqential subsections.
for example- contagious subarray of size 3 with max sum
